    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> May 1st, 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how your information is collected, used, and
      protected when you visit my personal portfolio website.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information I Collect</h2>
    <p>
      This website does <strong>not</strong> collect any personal information
      directly (such as names, emails, or contact forms). The only data
      collected is through <strong>Google Analytics</strong>, which gathers
      anonymized usage data.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Google Analytics</h2>
    <p>Google Analytics collects information such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pages visited</li>
      <li>Time spent on each page</li>
      <li>Type of browser and operating system</li>
      <li>Device type (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This information is aggregated and anonymized. Google may use this data in
      accordance with their
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank"
        >Privacy Policy</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      I do not sell, trade, or transfer your personal data to third parties.
      Data collected via Google Analytics may be processed by Google as part of
      their analytics services.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      This website uses cookies only for analytics purposes. Please refer to the
      <a href="cookie-policy.html">Cookie Policy</a> for more details.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Since no personal data is collected or stored by me directly, there is no
      personal information to access, update, or delete. However, you can manage
      your cookie preferences through your browser settings.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      Although no personal data is collected through this site, I take
      reasonable steps to ensure the site's general security, including the use
      of HTTPS encryption.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be
      reflected on this page with an updated effective date.
    </p>
